TWRP v2.7.1.0 for Mediatek
==========================


Changelog :

- Add GUI option to change or repair file systems on individual partitions. The change is destructive so backup your data including internal sdcard first. This option should make it a little easier to migrate a device from ext4 -> f2fs, for instance. You will find this option under Wipe -> Advanced Wipe, then select only one partition and then press the Repair or Change File System button. If a developer has added f2fs support for your device and we don't have it in TWRP, please contact me via PM to arrange for it to be added.
- Various bugfixes to backup and restore
- Improvements to USB storage handling
- Added a class to search for files to make finding the correct brightness file automatic in most cases
- Various other bugfixes and tweaks
